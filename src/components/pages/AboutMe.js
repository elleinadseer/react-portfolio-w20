      Hi, I'm Danielle â€“ a junior web dev with a heart set on becoming a full-stack developer. My journey in the realm of technology is fueled by an unwavering passion for web design and a boundless curiosity about the digital world's potential for meaningful communication.<br></br><br></br>

My fascination with the intricate code that powers the internet led me to aspire to be a full-stack developer. From the front-end's visual allure to the back-end's intricate mechanics, I'm committed to mastering every layer of this digital landscape. I'm continuously learning, adapting, and embracing emerging technologies to stay ahead in this ever-evolving field.<br></br><br></br>

My other hobbies include gaming and pro wrestling! I'm generally very interested in story telling and I hope to incorporate my love of writing and the skills gained from my English Literature degree into designing websites that are easily understood and enjoyed by others. </p>
