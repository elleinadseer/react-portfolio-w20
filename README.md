# react-portfolio-w20 ![licenseBadge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description

I have been tasked to create a portfolio using React. This will contain multiple react components that will be reused on multiple pages, such as a contact page, a resume, a page containing images and names of six projects I have worked on and a short discriptive about me page. Using a mix of being reusable and singlular components will enhance my React abilities.

## Development

I'm not entirely sure that I fully met the criteria for the project aspect of the challenge criteria but due to time constraints I couldn't do further work and that and I would have do more to enhance the aesthetics of the portfolio had I had more time (due to approaching the end of the bootcamp.) That being said I do feel that I utilised the reusable aspects of the components and that I learnt from this project.

## Credits

I have heavily relied on information taught through the module 20 lessons of the bootcamp; copying and then editing code from the lessons of this module to fit my needs. I initially copied over code directly from activity 16 and 24 then changed the langunage to fit my needs for this project.
